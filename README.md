Virtual Piano
=============
Simple virtual piano using PyGame for the first time. I also used Nyquist, and Scikits.samplerate as an exploration of audio concepts. The wav file was generated using Nyquist using its piano library and the rest of the notes were then created by resampling the sound.
This repo is forked from the original at https://github.com/stemchan/virtual-piano.
I have updated piano.py to work with Python 3.x and have tested it with Python 3.6.5.
